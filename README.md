Research Alignment

Research and alignment frameworks for the AI Governance Stack.

This repository contains the conceptual and experimental foundation for:
	•	Structural Empathy AI → frameworks for modeling empathetic and aligned AI behavior.
	•	Wright Model → a proposed alignment model that balances constraints, freedom, and ethical grounding.
	•	Phase1 Prototypes → early implementations and testbeds to validate ideas in practice.

🧩 Structural Empathy AI

Structural Empathy AI is an approach to alignment that:
	•	Embeds empathetic reasoning structures into AI systems.
	•	Focuses on context-awareness, human safety, and value alignment.
	•	Bridges behavioral signals (from SignalStack) with policy enforcement (via Middleware-Core).

Goal: Ensure that AI does not just follow rules, but understands why rules exist and adapts within safe boundaries.

🏛 Wright Model

The Wright Model is a governance and alignment framework that defines:
	•	Constraint Layer → Hard policies and red lines (e.g., no self-harm content).
	•	Empathy Layer → Behavioral modeling to adapt responses in sensitive cases.
	•	Freedom Layer → Space for AI to remain creative, flexible, and useful while respecting human values.

This layered model is a core building block for ethical, safe, and trustworthy AI.

🧪 Phase1 Prototypes

Early-stage experiments validating these concepts:
	•	Simulation environments for empathetic AI decision-making.
	•	Prototype alignment models combining signals + policies.
	•	Case studies: self-harm prevention, misinformation blocking, empathy in customer support contexts.

These prototypes are not production-ready, but they inform the evolution of the AI Governance Stack.

🔗 Relationship to Other Repos
	•	Policy Packs → Provides the YAML compliance rules.
	•	SignalStack → Supplies behavioral and emotional signals.
	•	Middleware-Core → Enforces policies and integrates alignment strategies at runtime.

Research-Alignment ties these components together conceptually.

⸻

📅 Roadmap
	•	Document Wright Model v0.2 (updated theory paper)
	•	Add Phase2 prototypes with richer empathy modeling
	•	Publish benchmark results on alignment effectiveness
	•	Release example datasets for empathy-driven AI
