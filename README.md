# Structural Empathy AI

Structural Empathy AI (SEAI) is a research framework exploring how AI systems 
can embed *empathy as a structural property*, not just as surface-level behavior.  
The goal is to create governance mechanisms that ensure AI respects human 
vulnerabilities, dignity, and context.

## Core Concepts
- **Empathy as Constraint** → embed empathetic limits directly into models.  
- **Signal Sovereignty** → preserve human emotional signals as private assets.  
- **Governance by Design** → enforce rules through infrastructure, not only policy.  

## Applications
- Safer conversational agents (reducing harm and emotional manipulation).  
- Ethical copilots for healthcare, education, and therapy support.  
- Research foundation for alignment and compliance frameworks.
